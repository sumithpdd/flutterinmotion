### RxDart

ReactiveX is an API for asynchronous programming with observable streams. As the website says, "ReactiveX is a combination of the best ideas from the Observer pattern, the Iterator pattern, and functional programming."
The pattern is supported in many languages. Streams are like a water hose – at one end is our entry point, and the other end is the Observable. In between is the stream. As data is added to the stream, one or more Observers can receive the data and react to it. Henceforth, the term ReactiveX. If there is no Observer, the data drops off the stream.

To help with creating launch icons, there is a flutter_launcher_icons package at the pub.dev.
This package helps us create the icons for the different platforms and OS versions. Let's set up the package. In our pubspec.yaml file, find the dev_dependencies section and add the reference to the flutter_launcher_icons. The dev_dependency allows us to add packages that are only needed during development.

 Now we can run the command flutter pub pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main.

Congratulations, you’ve reached the end of the course!
